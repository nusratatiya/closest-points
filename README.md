# Closest Schools

Programming assignment for CSCI0302: Algorithms and Comlpexity at Middlebury College

Developed a program that that finds the closest pair of K-12 schools in Vermont through the implementation of the closest points algorithm in O(nlogn) runtime complexity. 

## Description
Through a divide-and-conquer aproach, this program determines which schools should be consolidated into one under the hypothetical situation that many towns are merging schools (combining students in two neighboring towns into one school) due to the decreasing number of school-aged children in Vermont. 

## Getting Started
### Executing the Program
1. To run from the command line, open a terminal in the directory where ClosestSchools is located.
2. To compile, type: 
    ```
    javac ClosestSchools/*.java 
    ```
3. To run, type:
    ```
    java -cp . ClosestSchools.Main 
    ```
